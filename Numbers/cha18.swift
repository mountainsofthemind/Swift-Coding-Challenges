/*
Challenge 18: Recreate the pow() function 
Difficulty: Easy 
Create a function that accepts positive two integers, 
and raises the first to the power of the second. 
Tip: If you name your function myPow() or challenge18(), 
you’ll be able to use the built-in pow() for your tests. 
The built-in pow() uses doubles, so you’ll need to typecast. 
Sample input and output 
1. The inputs 4 and 3 should return 64, i.e. 4 multiplied by itself 3 times. 
2. The inputs 2 and 8 should return 256, i.e. 2 multiplied by itself 8 times.
